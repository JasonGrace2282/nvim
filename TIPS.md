# Tips
A collection of cool stuff I learned in Vim

- Use `q<register>` to record actions, and `q` again to finish them. Then you can replay from a register via `@<register>`
- Use `zc` for closing a fold, and `zo` for opening a fold.
- Vim has support for code spellings via `z=`
- `sed` (via `:%s`) is absolutely overpowered
